The final code is provided in the file "assignment2_161082.R"

Please input the data in csv format by providing the address of the test file in the first line of the code.
Please ensure that the first line of the data set is not the heading since the first line in the csv file is most likely a heading.
Use the following command
	data <- read.csv("~/testdata_161082.csv", header=TRUE)
where "~/testdata_161082.csv" is the address of the test file.

Run the code.

You can view the classes assigned by the algorithm in R by running the last line in the file i.e
	View(datatest)
Otherwise you can view the results already stored in a csv file under the name "161082.csv" in the working directory.



Note. Just in case the test set has a different format from the intended input format, I have provided a sample csv file in the zip under the name sample.csv for convenience.

Note. The file "working_code.R" contains the code of how the coefficient and parameter values were derived. THIS FILE DOES NOT CLASSIFY ANYTHING.
